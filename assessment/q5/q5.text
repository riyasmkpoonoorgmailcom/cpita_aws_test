a. First three questions I really joined answering and was able to do well.
b.Fourth question which asked to create all those resources using cloudformation casued me some issues as I was getting some 
errors during the stack creation.
c.Here I have created some resources using AWS console and other resources using AWS CLI command. But in QA and production environments I would
try to create all the resources including IAM roles using cloudformation only.
